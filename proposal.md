# Modeling Trophic Cascades due to Toxic Algal Blooms
## Nathaniel Haulk

### Introduction:

Trophic cascades are a phenomenon where a change in the number of predators that lead to large shifts in prey populations. These are often caused by extreme environmental events leading to large die-offs in those populations. Algal blooms, often caused by the addition of pollutants like nitrogen and phosphate, can lead to large die-outs in aquatic ecosystems. These large die-outs often disproportionately affect the predator populations and can actually lead to situations where prey populations benefit more that die-off. Little work has gone into understanding how different intensities of algal blooms affect wildlife. Using mathematical models can lead to a better idea of when trophic cascades will occur and how changes in intensity of algal blooms can affect population sizes of both predators and prey. Few studies have also looked into how multiple linked predator-prey systems can be affected by trophic cascades..
