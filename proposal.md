# Modeling Trophic Cascades due to Toxic Algal Blooms
## Nathaniel Haulk

### Introduction:

Trophic cascades are a phenomenon where a change in the number of predators that lead to large shifts in prey populations. These are often caused by extreme environmental events leading to large die-offs of individuals. Algal blooms, often caused by the addition of pollutants like nitrogen and phosphate, are a major cause of mortality in aquatic communities. These large die-outs often disproportionately affect the predator populations and can actually lead to situations where prey populations benefit more that die-off. However, little work has gone into understanding how different intensities of algal blooms affect wildlife. Using mathematical models, I hope to provide a better understanding of when trophic cascades will occur and how changes in intensity of algal blooms can affect the population sizes of both predators and prey. Few studies have also looked into how multiple linked predator-prey systems can be affected by trophic cascades. 

### Data Collection:

The majority of the data here will be generated using differential equations to model the changes in population size. Parameters used when calculating changes in populations will either be calculated by me or pulled from other literature sources that have performed similar experiments. For example, the natural mortality of predator and prey species will be derived from literature on aquatic organisms. Parameters such as mortality caused by algal blooms will be calculated using R depending on the strength of the bloom. 


### Questions to Answer:

1. How do algal blooms affect systems with one predator species and one prey species?   
2. How do these blooms affect systems with numerous predator species and numerous prey species?  
3. How does changing the intensity of algal blooms affect these organisms?  
4. In what situations do we see positive benefits to prey systems?  
5. Are there situations where we see positive benefit to predator systems?  
6. Does the species of algae matter in how organisms will react to the blooms?
