# Question 1


## Using For Loops:

## Using colMeans()


# Question 2

# Question 3

```{r}

## How many numbers of the Fibonacci Sequence you want to generate.
fib.length = 30

## Makes a list of 30 elements all set to 0.
Fib.seq = matrix(0, ncol = 1, nrow=fib.length)

## Sets the second term of the matrix to 1.
Fib.seq[2] = 1

## For loop to calcuate sum of previous two values.
for (i in 3:fib.length){
  Fib.seq[i] = Fib.seq[i-1] + Fib.seq[i-2]
  
} # Closes for loop

## Prints out the first 30 terms of the Fibonacci Sequence. 
print(Fib.seq)

```
