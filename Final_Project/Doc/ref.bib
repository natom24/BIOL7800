              The basic reproduction number, R
              0
              , determines the rate of spread of a communicable disease and therefore gives fundamental information needed to plan public health interventions. Using mortality records, we estimated the rate of spread of COVID-19 among 160 counties and county-aggregates in the USA at the start of the epidemic. We show that most of the high among-county variance is explained by four factors (R
              2
               = 0.70): the timing of outbreak, population size, population density, and spatial location. For predictions of future spread, population density and spatial location are important, and for the latter we show that SARS-CoV-2 strains containing the G614 mutation to the spike gene are associated with higher rates of spread. Finally, the high predictability of R
              0
              allows extending estimates to all 3109 counties in the conterminous 48 states. The high variation of R
              0
              argues for public health policies enacted at the county level for controlling COVID-19.},

	abstract = {The research work in this paper attempts to describe the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) with the help of a mathematical model using both the Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) and Fractional Differential Equation. The spread of the disease has been on the increase across the globe for some time with no end in sight. The research used the data of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria for the numerical simulation which has been fitted to the model. We brought in the consideration of both asymptomatic and symptomatic infected individuals with the fact that an exposed individual is either sent to quarantine first or move to one of the infected classes with the possibility that susceptible individual can also move to quarantined class directly. It was found that the proposed model has two equilibrium points; the disease-free equilibrium point (DFE) and the endemic equilibrium point (E1). Stability analysis of the equilibrium points shows (E0) is locally asymptotically stable whenever the basic reproduction number, R0{\textless}1 and (E1) is globally asymptotically stable whenever R0{\textgreater}1. Sensitivity analysis of the parameters in the R0 was conducted and the profile of each state variable was also depicted using the fitted values of the parameters showing the spread of the disease. The most sensitive parameters in the R0 are the contact rate between susceptible individuals and the rate of transfer of individuals from exposed class to symptomatically infected class. Moreover, the basic reproduction number for the data is calculated as R0≈1.7031. Existence and uniqueness of solution established via the technique of fixed point theorem. Also, using the least square curve fitting method together with the fminsearch function in the MATLAB optimization toolbox, we obtain the best values for some of the unknown biological parameters involved in the proposed model. Furthermore, we solved the fractional model numerically using the Atangana-Toufik numerical scheme and presenting different forms of graphical results that can be useful in minimizing the infection.},

Through both a selection-on-observables strategy and an instrumental variable approach, we ﬁnd that areas with greater exposure to the show downplaying the threat of COVID-19 experienced a greater number of cases and deaths.

	abstract = {Purpose
This study investigates the extent to which the Public Mask Mandate, a policy that requires the use of face masks in public, can protect people from developing COVID-19 symptoms during the initial stage of the pandemic from mid-April to early June 2020 in the United States (US).

Methods
We employ the difference-in-differences model that exploits the differential timing of the mask mandate implementation across states.

Results
Our findings show that the Public Mask Mandate significantly lowers the incidence of developing all COVID-19 symptoms by 0.29 percentage points. The estimate implies an average reduction of 290\%, compared to the proportion of the mandate-unaffected individuals who display all symptoms (0.1\%).

Conclusion
The study provides suggestive evidence for the health benefits of wearing masks in public in the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study also highlights the relevance of public mask wearing for the ongoing pandemic where the vaccination rate is precarious and access to vaccines is still limited in many countries.},

	abstract = {State policies mandating public or community use of face masks or covers in mitigating the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are hotly contested. This study provides evidence from a natural experiment on the effects of state government mandates for face mask use in public issued by fifteen states plus Washington, D.C., between April 8 and May 15, 2020. The research design is an event study examining changes in the daily county-level COVID-19 growth rates between March 31 and May 22, 2020. Mandating face mask use in public is associated with a decline in the daily COVID-19 growth rate by 0.9, 1.1, 1.4, 1.7, and 2.0 percentage points in 1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20, and 21 or more days after state face mask orders were signed, respectively. Estimates suggest that as a result of the implementation of these mandates, more than 200,000 COVID-19 cases were averted by May 22, 2020. The findings suggest that requiring face mask use in public could help in mitigating the spread of COVID-19.},

Here we present the results of epidemiological modelling which has informed policymaking in the UK and other countries in recent weeks. In the absence of a COVID-19 vaccine, we assess the potential role of a number of public health measures – so-called non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) – aimed at reducing contact rates in the population and thereby reducing transmission of the virus. In the results presented here, we apply a previously published microsimulation model to two countries: the UK (Great Britain specifically) and the US. We conclude that the effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is likely to be limited, requiring multiple interventions to be combined to have a substantial impact on transmission.},
