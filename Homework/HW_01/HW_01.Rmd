# Introduction

Hello! My name is **Nathaniel Haulk** and I am a first year graduate student in Bret Elderd's Lab. I am from Griffin, Georgia, a small town about an hour below Atlanta, Georgia. For my undergraduate, I went to the University of Georgia and majored in Ecology.

  My research focuses on using machine learning to map out how *Arabidopsis thaliana* coevolves with it's parasites. In my free time, I enjoy playing racquetball, watching TV, and playing guitar.
