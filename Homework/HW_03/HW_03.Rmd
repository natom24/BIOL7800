# Question 1

```{r}
set.seed(12) # to be reproducible

## Creates a 50 x 10 matrix with the values 1-500
A = matrix(data = runif(n = 1:500), nrow = 50, ncol = 10)

## Adds column names with lake and a number separated with a "_"
colnames(A) = paste("lake", 1:10, sep = "_")


#########################################
## Calculating Average using for loop
#########################################


## Creates a matrix to record means in
AloopMeans = matrix(data = 0, nrow = 1, ncol = 10)

## Adds column names with lake and a number separated with a "_"
colnames(AloopMeans) = paste("lake", 1:10, sep = "_")

## for loop to run through each column and calculate the mean.
for(i in 1:ncol(A)){
  
  ## 
  AloopMeans[i] = sum(A[,i])/NROW(A[,i])
}

## Print means generated using the for loop
print(AloopMeans)

####################################
## Using colMeans 
####################################

## Records Average from colMeans
AcolMeans = colMeans(A)

## Prints Averages from colMeans
print(AcolMeans)

```


# Question 2


```{r}

x = array(1:27, dim = c(3, 3, 3))

## Used to record each number as character


x.ap = NULL

for(i in 1:dim(x)[1]){
  for(q in 1:dim(x)[2]){
    x.char = NULL
    for(u in 1:dim(x)[3]){
      x.char = cbind(x.char,as.character(x[i,q,u]))
    }
   # x.ap[i,q] = 
  }
}

```

# Question 3

```{r}

## How many numbers of the Fibonacci Sequence you want to generate.
fib.length = 30

## Makes a list of 30 elements all set to 0.
Fib.seq = matrix(0, ncol = 1, nrow=fib.length)

## Sets the second term of the matrix to 1.
Fib.seq[2] = 1

## For loop to calcuate sum of previous two values.
for (i in 3:fib.length){
  Fib.seq[i] = Fib.seq[i-1] + Fib.seq[i-2]
  
} # Closes for loop

## Prints out the first 30 terms of the Fibonacci Sequence. 
print(Fib.seq)

```

# Question 4
```{r}
## Lists the top 105 songs from the radio station KITS San Francisco on Jan 1, 1992.
top105 = readLines("http://www.textfiles.com/music/ktop100.txt")

## Removes missing no. 54 and 55
top105 = top105[-c(64, 65)]

y = grep("^[0-9]+([.][0-9])?", top105, value = T)

z = gsub(" .*$", "",  y)

print(z)
```
