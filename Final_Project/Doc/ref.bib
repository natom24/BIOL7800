              The basic reproduction number, R
              0
              , determines the rate of spread of a communicable disease and therefore gives fundamental information needed to plan public health interventions. Using mortality records, we estimated the rate of spread of COVID-19 among 160 counties and county-aggregates in the USA at the start of the epidemic. We show that most of the high among-county variance is explained by four factors (R
              2
               = 0.70): the timing of outbreak, population size, population density, and spatial location. For predictions of future spread, population density and spatial location are important, and for the latter we show that SARS-CoV-2 strains containing the G614 mutation to the spike gene are associated with higher rates of spread. Finally, the high predictability of R
              0
              allows extending estimates to all 3109 counties in the conterminous 48 states. The high variation of R
              0
              argues for public health policies enacted at the county level for controlling COVID-19.},

	abstract = {The research work in this paper attempts to describe the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) with the help of a mathematical model using both the Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) and Fractional Differential Equation. The spread of the disease has been on the increase across the globe for some time with no end in sight. The research used the data of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria for the numerical simulation which has been fitted to the model. We brought in the consideration of both asymptomatic and symptomatic infected individuals with the fact that an exposed individual is either sent to quarantine first or move to one of the infected classes with the possibility that susceptible individual can also move to quarantined class directly. It was found that the proposed model has two equilibrium points; the disease-free equilibrium point (DFE) and the endemic equilibrium point (E1). Stability analysis of the equilibrium points shows (E0) is locally asymptotically stable whenever the basic reproduction number, R0{\textless}1 and (E1) is globally asymptotically stable whenever R0{\textgreater}1. Sensitivity analysis of the parameters in the R0 was conducted and the profile of each state variable was also depicted using the fitted values of the parameters showing the spread of the disease. The most sensitive parameters in the R0 are the contact rate between susceptible individuals and the rate of transfer of individuals from exposed class to symptomatically infected class. Moreover, the basic reproduction number for the data is calculated as R0≈1.7031. Existence and uniqueness of solution established via the technique of fixed point theorem. Also, using the least square curve fitting method together with the fminsearch function in the MATLAB optimization toolbox, we obtain the best values for some of the unknown biological parameters involved in the proposed model. Furthermore, we solved the fractional model numerically using the Atangana-Toufik numerical scheme and presenting different forms of graphical results that can be useful in minimizing the infection.},

This study investigates the extent to which the Public Mask Mandate, a policy that requires the use of face masks in public, can protect people from developing COVID-19 symptoms during the initial stage of the pandemic from mid-April to early June 2020 in the United States (US).

Methods
We employ the difference-in-differences model that exploits the differential timing of the mask mandate implementation across states.

Results
Our findings show that the Public Mask Mandate significantly lowers the incidence of developing all COVID-19 symptoms by 0.29 percentage points. The estimate implies an average reduction of 290\%, compared to the proportion of the mandate-unaffected individuals who display all symptoms (0.1\%).

Conclusion
The study provides suggestive evidence for the health benefits of wearing masks in public in the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study also highlights the relevance of public mask wearing for the ongoing pandemic where the vaccination rate is precarious and access to vaccines is still limited in many countries.},

This study provides evidence from a natural experiment on the effects of state government mandates for face mask use in public issued by fifteen states plus Washington, D.C., between April 8 and May 15, 2020. The research design is an event study examining changes in the daily county-level COVID-19 growth rates between March 31 and May 22, 2020. Mandating face mask use in public is associated with a decline in the daily COVID-19 growth rate by 0.9, 1.1, 1.4, 1.7, and 2.0 percentage points in 1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20, and 21 or more days after state face mask orders were signed, respectively. Estimates suggest that as a result of the implementation of these mandates, more than 200,000 COVID-19 cases were averted by May 22, 2020.

In the absence of a COVID-19 vaccine, we assess the potential role of a number of public health measures – so-called non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) – aimed at reducing contact rates in the population and thereby reducing transmission of the virus. In the results presented here, we apply a previously published microsimulation model to two countries: the UK (Great Britain specifically) and the US.

However, the mask adoption rate in the United States is still less than optimal. This study aims to understand the beliefs held by individuals who oppose the use of facial masks, and the evidence that they use to support these beliefs, to inform the development of targeted public health communication strategies.Materials and methodsWe analyzed a total of 771\&nbsp;268 U.S.-based tweets between January to October 2020. We developed machine learning classifiers to identify and categorize relevant tweets, followed by a qualitative content analysis of a subset of the tweets to understand the rationale of those opposed mask wearing.ResultsWe identified 267\&nbsp;152 tweets that contained personal opinions about wearing facial masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19. While the majority of the tweets supported mask wearing, the proportion of anti-mask tweets stayed constant at about a 10\% level throughout the study period. Common reasons for opposition included physical discomfort and negative effects, lack of effectiveness, and being unnecessary or inappropriate for certain people or under certain circumstances. The opposing tweets were significantly less likely to cite external sources of information such as public health agencies' websites to support the arguments.ConclusionsCombining machine learning and qualitative content analysis is an effective strategy for identifying public attitudes toward mask wearing and the reasons for opposition. The results may inform better communication strategies to improve the public perception of wearing masks and, in particular, to specifically address common anti-mask beliefs.},

	doi = {10.1016/S1473-3099(21)00566-1},
	abstract = {Background
On Dec 20, 2020, Israel initiated a nationwide COVID-19 vaccination campaign for people aged 16 years and older and exclusively used the Pfizer–BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (tozinameran). We provide estimates of the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related admissions to hospital (ie, hospitalisations) and deaths averted by the nationwide vaccination campaign.
Methods
In this retrospective surveillance study, we used national surveillance data routinely collected by the Israeli Ministry of Health from the first 112 days (Dec 20, 2020, up to our data cutoff of April 10, 2021) of Israel's vaccination campaign to estimate the averted burden of four outcomes: SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related hospitalisations, severe or critical hospitalisations, and deaths. As part of the campaign, all individuals aged 16 years and older were eligible for inoculation with the BNT162b2 vaccine in a two-dose schedule 21 days apart. We estimated the direct effects of the immunisation programme for all susceptible individuals (ie, with no previous evidence of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection) who were at least partly vaccinated (at least one dose and at least 14 days of follow-up after the first dose). We estimated the number of SARS-CoV-2 infection-related outcomes averted on the basis of cumulative daily, age-specific rate differences, comparing rates among unvaccinated individuals with those of at least partly vaccinated individuals for each of the four outcomes and the (age-specific) size of the susceptible population and proportion that was at least partly vaccinated.
Findings
We estimated that Israel's vaccination campaign averted 158 665 (95\% CI 144 640–172 690) SARS-CoV-2 infections, 24 597 (18 942–30 252) hospitalisations, 17 432 (12 770–22 094) severe or critical hospitalisations, and 5532 (3085–7982) deaths. 16 213 (65·9\%) of 24 597 hospitalisations and 5035 (91·0\%) of 5532 of deaths averted were estimated to be among those aged 65 years and older. We estimated 116 000 (73·1\%) SARS-CoV-2 infections, 19 467 (79·1\%) COVID-19-related hospitalisations, and 4351 (79\%) deaths averted were accounted for by the fully vaccinated population.
Interpretation
Without the national vaccination campaign, Israel probably would have had triple the number of hospitalisations and deaths compared with what actually occurred during its largest wave of the pandemic to date, and the health-care system might have become overwhelmed. Indirect effects and long-term benefits of the programme, which could be substantial, were not included in these estimates and warrant future research.

Here, we consider spatial heterogeneity, defined as ‘patchiness’ of the host population. After briefly reviewing how disease persistence is influenced by population size, reproduction number and infectious period, we explore its dependence on the level of spatial heterogeneity. Analysis and simulation of disease transmission in a symmetric meta-population suggest that disease persistence typically becomes worse as spatial heterogeneity increases, although local persistence optima can occur for infections with oscillatory population dynamics. We obtain insight into the dynamics that underlie the observed persistence patterns by studying the infection prevalence correlation between patches and by comparing full-model simulations to results obtained using simplified patch-level descriptions of the interplay between local extinctions and between-patch transmissions. The observed patterns are interpreted in terms of rescue effects for strong spatial heterogeneity and in terms of between-patch coherence and synchronization effects at intermediate and weak levels of heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {Abstract: The distinction between infection and disease may be subtle, and detection of disease in wild animal populations depends on the sophistication of sampling design and diagnostic techniques used in examining animal populations. The impact of infection on the host is dependent not only on the pathogenicity of the infection but also on the interactions between infection and other factors such as nutritional status and stress. In this paper I review mechanisms by which parasitic infections can influence the survival, reproduction, and movement patterns of infected individuals. I then discuss the implications for host populations, in particular with reference to the potential of parasites to regulate the abundance of host populations. The implications of infection and disease on host populations are then extended to demonstrate consequences on community structure. Difficulties associated with assessing the level of infection or disease in wild animal populations are discussed and used to account for the frequently held belief that disease rarely occurs in wild animal populations. Finally, the consequences of infection and disease for conservation biology are outlined. Disease is considered with regard to introductions and maintenance of genetic diversity. Emphasis is placed on the dangers associated with forcing animals into high-density situations. High host densities lead directly to increased disease because of increased transmission rates, and also indirectly increase disease because of synergistic interactions between infection, reduced nutritional status of the host population, and increased stress all associated with high-density situations. I recommend a surveillance program for monitoring prevalence or intensity in selected indicator age classes as a first step for preventing major disease problems in animal populations. I conclude that infection and disease will be an important determinant of the health and well-being of animal populations, and as such must be considered in the design of conservation policy.},

	abstract = {Purpose COVID-19 mortality rates are higher in rural versus urban areas in the United States, threatening to exacerbate the existing rural mortality penalty. To save lives and facilitate economic recovery, we must achieve widespread vaccination coverage. This study compared adult COVID-19 vaccination rates across the US rural-urban continuum and across different types of rural counties. Methods We retrieved vaccination rates as of August 11, 2021, for adults aged 18+ for the 2,869 counties for which data were available from the CDC. We merged these with county-level data on demographic and socioeconomic composition, health care infrastructure, 2020 Trump vote share, and USDA labor market type. We then used regression models to examine predictors of COVID-19 vaccination rates across the USDA's 9-category rural-urban continuum codes and separately within rural counties by labor market type. Findings As of August 11, 45.8\% of adults in rural counties had been fully vaccinated, compared to 59.8\% in urban counties. In unadjusted regression models, average rates declined monotonically with increasing rurality. Lower rural rates are explained by a combination of lower educational attainment and higher Trump vote share. Within rural counties, rates are lowest in farming and mining-dependent counties and highest in recreation-dependent counties, with differences explained by a combination of educational attainment, health care infrastructure, and Trump vote share. Conclusion Lower vaccination rates in rural areas is concerning given higher rural COVID-19 mortality rates and recent surges in cases. At this point, mandates may be the most effective strategy for increasing vaccination rates.},

However, if collected over country or regional scales, these metrics hide important smaller-scale, local dynamics. We examine how commonly used epidemiological metrics differ for each individual state within the United States during the initial COVID-19 outbreak. We found that the detected case number and trajectory of early detected cases differ considerably between states. We then test for correlations with testing protocols, interventions and population characteristics. We find that epidemic dynamics were most strongly associated with non-pharmaceutical government actions during the early phase of the epidemic. In particular, early social distancing restrictions, particularly on restaurant operations, was correlated with increased doubling times. Interestingly, we also found that states with little tolerance for deviance from enforced rules saw faster early epidemic growth. Together with other correlates such as population density, our results highlight the different factors involved in the heterogeneity in the early spread of COVID-19 throughout the United States. Although individual states are clearly not independent, they can serve as small, natural experiments in how different demographic patterns and government responses can impact the course of an epidemic.},

We analyse highly-resolved spatial variables for cities in China together with case count data in order to investigate the role of climate, urbanization, and variation in interventions across China. Here we show that the epidemic intensity of COVID-19 is strongly shaped by crowding, such that epidemics in dense cities are more spread out through time, and denser cities have larger total incidence. Observed differences in epidemic intensity are well captured by a metapopulation model of COVID-19 that explicitly accounts for spatial hierarchies. Densely-populated cities worldwide may experience more prolonged epidemics. Whilst stringent interventions can shorten the time length of these local epidemics, although these may be difficult to implement in many affected settings.},

	abstract = {Background
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, there is a question of whether hospitals have adequate resources to manage patients. We aim to investigate global hospital bed (HB), acute care bed (ACB), and intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity and determine any correlation between these hospital resources and COVID-19 mortality.
Method
Cross-sectional study utilizing data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and other official organizations regarding global HB, ACB, ICU bed capacity, and confirmed COVID-19 cases/mortality. Descriptive statistics and linear regression were performed.
Results
A total of 183 countries were included with a mean of 307.1 HBs, 413.9 ACBs, and 8.73 ICU beds/100,000 population. High-income regions had the highest mean number of ICU beds (12.79) and HBs (402.32) per 100,000 population whereas upper middle-income regions had the highest mean number of ACBs (424.75) per 100,000. A weakly positive significant association was discovered between the number of ICU beds/100,000 population and COVID-19 mortality. No significant associations exist between the number of HBs or ACBs per 100,000 population and COVID-19 mortality.
Conclusions
Global COVID-19 mortality rates are likely affected by multiple factors, including hospital resources, personnel, and bed capacity. Higher income regions of the world have greater ICU, acute care, and hospital bed capacities. Mandatory reporting of ICU, acute care, and hospital bed capacity/occupancy and information relating to coronavirus should be implemented. Adopting a tiered critical care approach and targeting the expansion of space, staff, and supplies may serve to maximize the quality of care during resurgences and future disasters.},
