#sort(unique(data_plant$taxon_name))

## Pulls the genus for each plant
data_plant$genus = sub(" .*", "", data_plant$taxon_name)

## Selects a random number 100 times between 1 and the length of data_plant
i = sample(1:nrow(data_plant), 100, replace=FALSE)

## Records the genus at the random 
genus_samp = data_plant$genus[i]

## Prints out 100 genus 
print(genus_samp)
