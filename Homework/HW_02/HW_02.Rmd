# Question 1
## mtcars[mtcars$cyl < 6]
  
|       Missing a comma, should be:  
|       **mtcars[mtcars$cyl < 6,]**

## mtcars[-1:3,]  
  
|      Needs to be a list so it knows not to include 1 to 3
|      **mtcars[-c(1:3),]**
  
## mtcars[mtcars$cyl = 8, ]  

|      Needs a second equals sign:  
|      **mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 8, ]**

## mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 4 | 6, ]  

|      Needs a list of numbers to run through rather than using '|':  
|      **mtcars[mtcars$cyl == c(4,6), ]**



# Question 2

x = 1:5  
x[NA]  

# Question 3

mtcars[1:15] vs mtcars[1:15, ]

# Question 4

x = matrix(c(1:3, NA, 5:7, NA, NA), nrow = 3)  
x[is.na(x)] = 0  

# Question 5
```{r Question5, echo = TRUE}
## Creates empty row mpg_2 to record what gas efficiency category the car falls under
mtcars['mpg_2'] = NA

## For loop to run through every row of mtcars
for(i in 1:nrow(mtcars)){
  
  ## Tests for low category (mpg < 16)
  if(mtcars[i,1] < 16){
    mtcars[i,12] = "Low"
  } # Closes if loop
  
  ## Tests for Low_intermediate category (16 <= mpg <21)
  else if(mtcars[i,1] < 21){
    mtcars[i,12] = "Low_intermediate"
  } # Closes first else if loop

  ## Tests for Intermediate_high category (21 <= mpg <26)
  else if(mtcars[i,1] < 26){
    mtcars[i,12] = "Intermediate_high"
  } # Closes second else if loop

  ## Sets all other values at high (26 <= mpg)
  else{
    mtcars[i,12] = "High"
  }# Closes else loop
}# Closes for loop

print(mtcars)

```
